<p>This document details the project plan for the development of “crazyCrawler.” <br>

Apart from project investors, this document is intended for the developers, designers, and testers who are working on “crazyCrawler.” 
This plan includes a summary of:</p>

<ul>
      <li>How the system is going to function</li>
      <li>The technology and interfaces used for the development of the project</li>
      <li>Scope of the project from the development viewpoint</li>
      <li>System Features</li>
      <li>Other nonfunctional Requirements</li>
      <li>Overall Description</li>
</ul>

<p>Many big data companies depend on data that is scraped from the internet. They heavily depend on web crawlers. Often their job gets messy when they are trying to
fetch files like pdfs, documents or texts. We are developing a search engine which any data driven company/ user can use to easily fetch the document they are looking 
for. It is as easy as putting a URL in the search bar and choosing what files to get, and viola they will have all links leading to such files crawled and indexed for 
them. Users can use this intuitive search engine not only to easily fetch such files, but also to create clusters on this data.</p>
