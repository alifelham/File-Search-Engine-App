<p>This document details the project plan for the development of “crazyCrawler.” <br>

Apart from project investors, this document is intended for the developers, designers, and testers who are working on “crazyCrawler.” 
This plan includes a summary of:</p>

<ul>
      <li>How the system is going to function</li>
      <li>The technology and interfaces used for the development of the project</li>
      <li>Scope of the project from the development viewpoint</li>
      <li>System Features</li>
      <li>Other nonfunctional Requirements</li>
      <li>Overall Description</li>
</ul>

<p>Many big data companies depend on data that is scraped from the internet. They heavily depend on web crawlers. Often their job gets messy when they are trying to
fetch files like pdfs, documents or texts. We are developing a search engine which any data driven company/ user can use to easily fetch the document they are looking 
for. It is as easy as putting a URL in the search bar and choosing what files to get, and viola they will have all links leading to such files crawled and indexed for 
them. Users can use this intuitive search engine not only to easily fetch such files, but also to create clusters on this data.</p>

<p>"crazyCrawler" is a new, self-contained product designed with the aim to make web searching easier, efficient and organized. It is a self-sustaining product without any subsystem or integrable part as of the current release. The product is for any individual or group looking to search data from the web in a precisely effective manner. Using it will enable users to make clusters of URLs and search for specific contents in their cluster. Users can download, store and use the contents easily and efficiently. Especially for the regular users, fast scraping of data using web crawlers is of great importance. With the aim to make it easier for them, the product is developed.</p>

<h3 id="product-functions">2.2 Product Functions</h3>

  <li>Download / Save content: User will be able to download the searched contents into their system.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="user-class">2.3 User Classes and Characteristics.</h3>

<p>The following user classes are classified based on the type of use of the product:
<ul>
  <li>Professional Users: This includes any user who will be using the product for their professional work under any company, organization or institution. They are the most important category of users who will, perhaps use the product most frequently and at a large scale. A large quantity of data will be required to be scraped by them for their works and this product will be of utmost urgency for them.</li>

  <li>Personal Users: This class of users will be anyone who uses the product for their personal uses only. Any individual such as a student, teacher, an employee or anyone who uses the product for non-professional work are included in this category. After professional users, this category of users are the most important.</li>

  <li>Developers: This group of people are the programmers who are and will be working on the product in order to further develop it, maintain it and update it in the future. They will be using the product to test if it is working correctly, to update certain features and maintain them on a regular basis.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3 id="operating-env">2.4 Operating Environment</h3>

<p>
  The product will be suitable for the following hardware platforms:
  <ul>
    <li>Computers</li>
    <li>Mobile Phones</li>
    <li>Tablets</li>
  </ul>

  The product will be suitable for the following operating systems:
  <ul>
    <li>Web Application: Any operating system having the following web browsers: Internet Explorer, Chrome or Brave</li>

    <li>Android Application: Only available for the devices with Android operating system.</li>
  </ul>

  The product will be compatible with any version of the aforementioned hardware platforms and operating system releases.
</p>

<h3 id="design-imp-constraints">2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>

<p>From the part of the developers, there are some limitations. Such as, many websites (like amazon.com) do not allow data crawling from their website. There are many such websites who have certain constraints over data crawling. This is a limitation from the develper's end. In addition, the memory constraint is also a limitation from the developer's end. All the data in all the websites need to be scraped and saved into the database, which might lead to some memory issue. Lastly, since the product is for web and android only, it will not be available for the users of operating systems other than android. </p>

<p>In order to use the product from any device other than android, the user must be using the web application. In the making of the product, Django framework has been used with the integration of Rest API in the backend. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is used in the frontend of the web application. The product is developed in Python for the web application and in Kotlin for the mobile application. The platform PyCharm is used to manage, edit and integrate the different parts of the product. For the maintenance of the delivered product, the developers themselves will be responsible and no intermediate oragnization will be involved.</p>

<h3 id="user-documentation">2.6 User Documentation</h3>

<p>As of the current release, no user manual, online help, tutorials or any sort of user documentation will be released for the product. The product is very straight-forward and easy to use. Users will be able to use the product without any sort of guide or help whatsoever. However, in the future releases, if any advanced features are added to the product for which we think user documentation will be required, it will be released then.
</p>

<h3 id="assumption-dependencies">2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>

<p>As for the web application part of the product, a browser is required to access it. It is assumed that the browser that the user uses is compatible with the most updated version of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is assumed that the browser is able to render, integrate and display the application correctly.</p>

<p>As for the mobile application part of the product, Kotlin will be used, which interoperates fully with Java. So, it is assumed that the user will have Java installed on their phone. All these dependencies are static and the smooth ruunning of the product depends on these factors.</p>

<h2 id="external-interface">3. External Interface Requirements</h2>
<h3 id="user-interface">3.1 User Interfaces</h3>

<p>The user interface for the search engine shall be compatible to any web browser Internet Explorer, Chrome or Brave by which user can access to the system.
