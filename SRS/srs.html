          <p>This document details the project plan for the development of “crazyCrawler.” <br>

            Apart from project investors, this document is intended for the developers, designers, and testers who are
            working on “crazyCrawler.”
            This plan includes a summary of:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>How the system is going to function</li>
            <li>The technology and interfaces used for the development of the project</li>
            <li>Scope of the project from the development viewpoint</li>
            <li>System Features</li>
            <li>Other nonfunctional Requirements</li>
            <li>Overall Description</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Many big data companies depend on data that is scraped from the internet. They heavily depend on web
            crawlers. Often their job gets messy when they are trying to
            fetch files like pdfs, documents or texts. We are developing a search engine which any data driven company/
            user can use to easily fetch the document they are looking
            for. It is as easy as putting a URL in the search bar and choosing what files to get, and viola they will
            have all links leading to such files crawled and indexed for
            them. Users can use this intuitive search engine not only to easily fetch such files, but also to create
            clusters on this data.</p>

          </p>

          <h3 id="design-imp-constraints">2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>

          <p>From the part of the developers, there are some limitations. Such as, many websites (like amazon.com) do
            not allow data crawling from their website. There are many such websites who have certain constraints over
            data crawling. This is a limitation from the develper's end. In addition, the memory constraint is also a
            limitation from the developer's end. All the data in all the websites need to be scraped and saved into the
            database, which might lead to some memory issue. Lastly, since the product is for web and android only, it
            will not be available for the users of operating systems other than android. </p>

          <p>In order to use the product from any device other than android, the user must be using the web application.
            In the making of the product, Django framework has been used with the integration of Rest API in the
            backend. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is used in the frontend of the web application. The product is developed
            in Python for the web application and in Kotlin for the mobile application. The platform PyCharm is used to
            manage, edit and integrate the different parts of the product. For the maintenance of the delivered product,
            the developers themselves will be responsible and no intermediate oragnization will be involved.</p>

          <h3 id="user-documentation">2.6 User Documentation</h3>

          <p>As of the current release, no user manual, online help, tutorials or any sort of user documentation will be
            released for the product. The product is very straight-forward and easy to use. Users will be able to use
            the product without any sort of guide or help whatsoever. However, in the future releases, if any advanced
            features are added to the product for which we think user documentation will be required, it will be
            released then.
          </p>

          <h3 id="assumption-dependencies">2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>

          <p>As for the web application part of the product, a browser is required to access it. It is assumed that the
            browser that the user uses is compatible with the most updated version of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is
            assumed that the browser is able to render, integrate and display the application correctly.</p>

          <p>As for the mobile application part of the product, Kotlin will be used, which interoperates fully with
            Java. So, it is assumed that the user will have Java installed on their phone. All these dependencies are
            static and the smooth ruunning of the product depends on these factors.</p>

          <h2 id="external-interface">3. External Interface Requirements</h2>
          <h3 id="user-interface">3.1 User Interfaces</h3>

          <p>The user interface for the search engine shall be compatible to any web browser Internet Explorer, Chrome
            or Brave by which user can access to the system. In addition to that it shall be compatible with mobile.
